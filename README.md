# Project Overview
In this project, I created an interactive Power BI dashboard to analyze and visualize data related to auto insurance. The dashboard provides actionable insights into key metrics and trends, empowering stakeholders to make informed decisions.

# Features 
### 1. Data Import and Transformation
- Imported raw data from various sources, ensuring a seamless integration process.
- Utilized Power Query Editor to clean, preprocess, and transform data for accurate analysis.

### 2. Interactive Visualizations
- Designed an array of visualizations including bar charts, line graphs, pie charts, and maps.
- Ensured visualizations are easy to interpret while presenting in-depth details.

### 3. Dynamic Buttons and Bookmarks
- Implemented buttons and bookmarks to improve navigation across different dashboard pages.
- Enabled users to switch seamlessly between pages, enhancing user experience and storytelling.

### 4. Filtering and Slicing
- Incorporated slicers and filters for dynamic data exploration.
- Users can drill down and slice data by various attributes such as coverage type, policy type, customer type, sales channels, and vehicles.

### 5. Key Metrics
